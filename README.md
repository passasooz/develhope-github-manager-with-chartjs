a little exercise for my students who want to grow

## WTF..??
if you are reading it means that you have nothing to do, so here is a little exercise for you :)

You have to create a web page that through GITHUB API authentication shows statistics graphs using the Chart.js library regarding the various repositories in your profile.

In the graphs you can show the values you prefer, I leave you some examples:
- repo with multiple commits
- repo with multiple issues

Show at least one pie chart and one bar chart.

It would be nice to have a graph with the trend of commits over time.

## HOW TO
Adding a branch with named like your "name_surname" to this repo.

Enjoy it!
